</div>

## Description:
  This is a demo exercise based on the ***Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN*** Week14 starter kit.</br>
  
  This is a Todo list. It will add to the ToDo menu after writing in the input field and pressing Enter, or it will drop elements from the list if clicking the item(s).

## Installation:
  1. Downloads each file into one file. <br>
    1. **index.html** <br>
    2. **index.js** <br>
    3. **form.js** <br>
    4. **todo.js** <br>
    5. **style.css** <br>
  3. Open shell and type **npm install --global http-server**.
     ```console
     npm install --global http-server
     ```
  4. Type **npm install**.
     ```console
     npm install
     ```
  5. type **http-server -c-1** to start the server.
     ```console
     http-server -c-1
     ```
  6. Go online and type **localhost:8080** in URL box.

## Roadmap:
   I would like to add in the near future random colors for each item in the list, but change the color of the item based on a priority menu (high, normal, low priority).
